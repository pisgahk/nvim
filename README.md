# What is this? / यह क्या है

This is a compilation of my configs for my .nvim configurations.
I hope that this inspires you to make your own and to rice your nvim to your preference.

Basically, most of the initial hardwork is by (3rfaanzubi)[https://github.com/3rfaan]. The other additional modifications are by me as usual.

So far Rust is supported as of April2k25 with full configuration. Anything extra, just add on.
